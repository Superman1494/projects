Developed a breast cancer detection system using Python, employing models like Random Forest and SVM. Utilized libraries
such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn for data preprocessing and evaluation, with results visualized through graphs and heat maps.
The highlight of the project is the comprehensive comparison of various machine learning models (including Random Forest,
AdaBoost, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, and Logistic Regression) for breast cancer detection, coupled with
robust performance evaluation and visualization techniques.
